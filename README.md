# BouncingBallz

This is a web application created using html5 canvas, where users can click on the screen to spawn a circle. This circle realistically obeys Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen, with a dampening effect on each bounce until it comes to a stop.

The user can
1. control the gravity
2. reset (clear all balls),
3. make a small ball instead of the ball if it becomes too large

The Balls get merged if they touch each other.
There are other beautiful visual and sound effects added. 

enjoy!!
